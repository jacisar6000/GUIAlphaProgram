I have been hired to create software for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. 
Without the software, workers on the production floor are physically producing items and having to write down what is produced 
in a production log book. Management would like the production tracking to be more automated so the workers don't need to spend 
as much time recording what was produced, the log will be more accurate, and it will be easier to generate production reports. 
In addition to the ability to record production, the software also needs the ability to add to the product line (the catalog of 
products that are able to be produced).

The user is able to added product names and manufacturers to the database when "Add Product" is clicked. 
The user is able to choose the quantity of the product up to 1-10 items.
